Direction 2. ESpecially labour first to understand the true nature of a state of sin, and a stateDirect. 2. of Grace.

Direction 3. TO know what a life of Holiness is, believe the Word of God, and those that haveDirect. 3. tryed it, and believe not the slanders of the Devil and of ungodly men, that never tryed or knew the things which they reproach.

Direction 4. THat thy understanding may be enlightned, and thy heart renewed, be much and seriousDirect. 4. in Reading the Word of God, and those Books that are fitted tomen in an unconverted state, and especially in hearing the plain and searching preaching of the word.

Direction 5. F thou wouldst not be destitute of saving Grace, let thy Reason be exercised about theDirect. 5. matters of thy salvation, in some proportion of frequent, sober, serious Thoughts, as thou art convinced the weight of the matter doth require.

Direction 6. SUffer not the Devil by company, pleasure or worldly business to divert or hinder theeDirect. 6. from these serious Considerations.

Direction 7. IF thou wouldst be converted and saved, be not a malicious or pievish enemy to thoseDirect. 7. that would convert and save thee: Be not angry with them that tell thee of thy sin or duty, as if they did thee wrong or hurt.

Direction 8. IF thou art willing indeed to be converted, do thy best to discover that yet thou art unconverted,Direct. 8. and in a lost and miserable state.

Direction 9. WHen you have found your selves in a state of sin and death, Understand and ConsiderDirect. 9. what a state that is.

Direction 10. WHen you have found out how sad a condition you are in, consider what there is inDirect. 10. sin to make you amends or repair your loss, that should be any hinderance to your Conversion.

Direction 11. ANd when you are casting up your account, as you put all that sin and the worldDirect. 11. will do for you in the one end of the scales, so put into the other the Comforts both of this life, and of that to come, which you must part with for your sins.

Direction 12. WHen you have thus considered of the condition you are in, consider also whetherDirect. 12. it be a condition to be rested in one day.

Direction 13. WHen thou art Resolved, past thy waverings and delayes, give up thy self entirely andDirect. 13. unreservedly to God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, as thy Happiness, thy Saviour and thy Sanctifier, in an hearty Consent to the Covenant of Grace.

Direction 14. IN present performance of thy Covenant with God, away with thy former sinful life; andDirect. 14. see that thou sin wilfully no more; but as far as thou art able, avoid the temptations which have deceived thee.

Direction 15. IF thou have sincerely given up thy self to God, and consented to his Covenant, shew itDirect. 15. by turning the face of thy endeavours and conversation quite another way, and by seeking Heaven more fervently and diligently, than ever thou soughtest the world, or fleshly pleasures.

Direction 16. ENgage thy self in the chearful constant use, of the means and helps appointed by God,Direct. 16. for thy confirmation and salvation.

Direction 18. IF you would prove true Converts, come over to God as your Father and felicity, withDirect. 18. desire and delight, and close with Christ, as your only Saviour with thankfulness and joy, and set upon the way of Godliness with pleasure and alacrity, as your exceeding priviledge, and the only way of profit, honour and content: and do it not as against your wills, as those that had rather do otherwise if they durst, and account the service of God an unsuitable and unpleasant thing.

Direction 19. REmember still that Conversion, is the turning from your carnal selves to God, andDirect. 1•. therefore that it engageth you in a perpetual opposition to your own corrupt Conceits and Wills, to mortifie and annihilate them, and captivate them wholly to the holy Word and Will of God.

    _ CHAP. II.I have si•ce written a Book on this subject, to which I refer the Reader for ful•er Direction. Directions to young Christians or Beginners in Religion, for their establishment and safe proceeding.

      * Direct. 1. TAke heed lest it be the Novelty or reputation of Truth and Godliness, that takes withDirect. 1. you, more than the solid Evidence of their Excellency and Necessity: lest when the Novelty and reputation are gone, your Religion wither and consume away.

      * Direct. 2. TAke heed of being Religious only in Opinion, without Zeal and holy practice; or only inDirect. 2. Zealous affection without a sound well grounded judgement: But see that Iudgement, Zeal and practice •e conjunct.

      * Direct. 3. LAbour to understand the true Method of Divinity, and see Truths in their several degreesLeg. Acost. l. 4. c. 21. & 22 de fructu catechizandi. Et Li. 5. and order; that you take not the last for the first; nor the lesser for the greater. Therefore see that you be well grounded in the Catechism; and refuse not to learn some Catechism that is sound and full, and keep it in memory while you live.

      * Direct. 4. BEgin not too early with Controversies in Religion: and when you come to them, let themDirect. 4. have but their due proportion of your time and zeal: But live daily upon these certain, great substantials, which all Christians are agreed in.

      * Direct. 5. BE very thankful for the great mercy of your Conversion: but yet overvalue not yourDirect. 5. first degrees of knowledge or holiness: but remember that you are yet but in your infancy, and must expect your growth and ripeness as the consequent of Time and Diligence.

      * Direct. 6. BE not discouraged at the difficulties and oppositions which will rise up before you, when you begin resolvedly to walk with God.

      * Direct. 7. IF it be in your power, live under a judicious, faithful, serious, searching, powerful Minister;Direct. 7. Sulpitius S〈…〉rus in ••t. Ma tini▪ no eth that none but Bishops were against him because he was unlearned and of no presence. and diligently attend his publick Teaching, and use his private Counsel for more particular directions and application, for the setling and managing the affairs of your souls; even as you take the advice of Physicions for your health, and of Lawyers for your estates, and Tutors for your studies.

      * Direct. 8. KEep right apprehensions of the excellency of Charity and Unity among believers, andDirect. 8. Against Uncha••••ableness and Schism. See more in T•n. 2. C•. 23. receive nothing hastily that is against them; especially take heed lest under pretence of their Authority, their Number, their Soundness, or their Holiness, you too much addict your selves to any Sect or Party, to the withdrawing of your special Love and just Communion from other Christians, and turning your Zeal to the interest of your Party, with a neglect of the common interest of the Church: But Love a Christian as a Christian, and promote the Unity and welfare of them all.

      * Direct. 9. TAke heed lest any persecution or wrong from others, provoke you to any unwarrantable passions and practices, and deprive you of the Charity, meekness and innocency of a Christian; or make you go beyond your bounds, in censuring, reviling, or resisting your Rulers, who are the Officers of God.

      * Direct. 10. WHen you are repenting of, or avoiding any extream, do it not without sufficientDirect. 10. fear and caution of the contrary extream.

      * Direct. 11. I Et not your first Opinions about the controverted difficulties in Religion, (where ScriptureDirect. 11. For Modesty in your first Opinions. is not very plain) be too peremptory, confident or fixed: But hold them modestly, with 〈…〉 your un•ipe understandings, and with room for further information, supposing it possible 〈…〉, that upon better instruction evidence and maturity, you may, in such things, change y•ur minds.

      * Direct. 12. IF Controversies •ccasion any Divisions where you live, be sure to look first to the interest〈1 paragraph〉 of Common Truth and Good, and to the exercise of Charity: And become not passionate contenders for any party in the division, or censurers of the peaceable, or of your Teachers that will not •ver〈…〉 their own understandings, to obtain with you the esteem of being Orthodox or zealous men: But suspect your own unripe understandings, and silence your Opinions till you are clear and certain, and j•yn rather with the moderate and the peace-makers than with the Contenders and Dividers.

      * Direct. 13. KNow that true Godliness is the Best Life upon Earth, and the only may to perfectDirect. 13. Happiness: Still apprehend it therefore, and Use it as the best: and with great diligence ••sist those Temptations which would make it seem to you a confounding grievous or unpleasant thing.

      * Direct. 14. BE very diligent in mortifying the desires and pleasures of the flesh; and keep a continualDirect. 14. watch upon your senses appetite and lusts; and cast not your selves upon temptations, occasions or opportunities of sinning, remembring that your salvation lyeth on your success.

      * Direct. 15. BE exceeding wary not only what Teachers you commit the guidance of your souls unto,Direct. 15. Nam si falsi & solo nomine tumidi, non modo non consulendi, sed vitandi sunt, quibus nihil est importunius, nihil insu si•s, &c. P•t•a c•. D•al. 117. li. 2. but also with what company you familiarly converse: That they be neither such as would corrupt your minds with error, or your hearts with viciousness, prof•neness, lukewarmness, or with a feavorish factious zeal: But choose, if possible, judicious, holy, heavenly, humble, unblameable, self-denying persons, to be your ordinary companions, and familiars; but especially for your near Relations.

      * Direct. 16. MAke careful choice of the Books which you read. Let the Holy Scriptures ever haveDirect. 10. the preheminence, and next them, the solid, lively, heavenly Treatises which best expound and apply the Scriptures: and next those, the credible Histories, especially of the Church, and Tractates upon inferiour Sciences and Arts: But take heed of the poyson of the Writings of false Teachers, which would corrupt your understandings: and of vain Romances, Play-books, and false Stories, which may bewitch your fantasies, and corrupt your hearts.

      * Direct. 17. TAke heed that you receive not a Doctrine of Libertinism as from the Gospel, nor conceiveDirect. 17. of Christ as an encourager of sin; nor pretend free grace for your carnal security or sloth: For this is but to set up another Gospel, and another Christ, or rather the Doctrine and works of the Devil against Christ and the Gospel, and to turn the Grace of God into wantonness.

      * Direct. 18. WAtch diligently hath against the more discernable decayes of grace, and againstDirect. 18. the degenerating of it into some carnal affections: or something counterfeit, and of another kind: And so also of Religious duties.

      * Direct. 19. PRomise not your selves long life, or prosperity and great matters in the world, lest it entangleDirect. 19. your hearts with transitory things, and engage you in ambitious or covetous designs, and steal away your hearts from God, and destroy all your serious apprehensions of Eternity.

For I take the Love of God kindled by Faith in Christ, with the full Denyal of our carnal selves, to be the sum of all Religion. But because I would not injure so great a duty by saying but a little of it; And therefore desire the Reader who studieth for Practice, and needeth such helps, to peruse the mentioned Books of Self-denyal, and Crucifying the World. which is the grand enemy to God and Godliness in the world; and from the three great branches of this Idolatry, viz. the Love of sensual pleasures, the Love of worldly wealth, and the proud desire and Love of worldly honour and esteem: And the mortifying of these must be much of the labour of your lives.
